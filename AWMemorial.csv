That is exactly what happened to a team of RAAF personnel at North-West Area Headquarters in Darwin, on August 14th, 1945. The Teleprinter Operator, Telegraphist and like personnel were on duty that fateful day when they received an emergency teleprinter signal issuing instructions to:

""Cancel all operations against the enemy forthwith including missions now airborne"".

These few words essentially heralded the closing of the Second World War, the Japanese accepting the Allied demand for unconditional surrender that very day.

This teleprinter signal was donated to the Australian War Memorial by one of the RAAF personnel who was there when the signal was received. It is one of several copies which were usually discarded once the top copy was delivered to the Operations Room.

It was certainly the message of a lifetime.

On 4-5 April 1975, Australia and the United States launched a daring mission that lifted over 3,000 orphaned and displaced children from Saigon, Vietnam. 

Over 200 children were evacuated to Australia, travelling in two RAAF C-130 Hercules from Saigon to Bangkok. They were met by a Qantas airliner which brought the children to Australia where they were immediately taken into hospital care.

Many of the children were extremely sick upon their arrival and tragically some did not survive. For those who did, their new lives with adoptive families in Australia would be mixed. Dominic Golding shares his story.

So why does the Australian War Memorial have a stuffed cockatoo?

When this sulphur crested cockatoo died in 1925, he was 47 years old, and was owned by one of the wealthiest women in Victoria and noted philanthropist Mrs Anne Fraser Bon. Mrs Bon had donated an ambulance to the Belgian Army during the war and from 1919 until her death in 1936, she reportedly gave a Christmas gift of twenty pounds to every Victorian soldier blinded in the war.

Mrs Bon loaned ‚ÄòCocky‚Äô to No 1 Rest Home, Wirth‚Äôs Park, Melbourne, to entertain rehabilitating First World War soldiers. Here, the Australian soldiers delighted in expanding Cocky‚Äôs extensive vocabulary, including two of his more popular phrases ‚ÄúShow your pass!‚Äù or ‚ÄúGo on, you‚Äôre a German!‚Äù, and a string of expletives that soon sent ‚ÄòCocky‚Äô home to Mrs Bon.

When ‚ÄòCocky‚Äô died, Mrs Bon sent him immediately to a taxidermist to have him displayed at the newly proposed Australian War Memorial. So what on first appearances is a stuffed bird, has ensured a rich story of rehabilitation and philanthropy has been preserved.

Giles‚Äô story is reflective of many who served during the First World War. Enlisting in May 1916, he served on the Western Front for most of the war. At Vauvillers, east of Villers-Bretonneux, Giles was recommended for a Military Medal for ""conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty.""

This vibrant artwork depicts the Contingent's arrival at Suakin in Sudan, with the men arriving wearing red tunics. The British issued the troops with khaki uniforms on their first day so that they would not be stand out so much on the battlefield.

The second image showcases examples of these early uniforms, including the beige field service jacket worn by Private Arthur Barrett (Service Number: 123). These pieces are among the oldest uniforms in the Memorial‚Äôs collection, with the field service jacket belonging to the oldest complete uniform in the Memorial's collection.

The contingent set sail from Sydney on 3 March 1885 amid much public fanfare, generated in part by the holiday declared to farewell the troops. The send-off was described as the most festive occasion in the colony's history.

It was generally agreed at the time that, no matter how small the military significance of the Australian contribution to the War in Sudan, it marked an important stage in the development of colonial self-confidence and was proof of the enduring link with Britain.

Facing high casualty rates and extreme conditions, aircrews would often employ lucky charms such as this crochet doll to help cope with the incredible stress of operations.

A stalwart ally in the face of the enemy, 'Myrtle the Turtle' was attached to the instrument panel of Short Stirling heavy bomber LJ 514 'B for Beer' flown by a mixed Australian and British aircrew.

'B for Beer' participated in at least 70 operations of varying type. Stirling‚Äôs were initially used for strategic bombing, but were later deployed in ‚ÄòMandrel‚Äô electronic deception operations in which they deployed ‚Äòwindow‚Äô, strips of foil used to spoof German radar.

‚ÄòMyrtle‚Äô proved lucky for Flight Lieutenant Lawrence 'Lawrie' McKenzie, who was a bomb aimer aboard ‚ÄòB for Beer‚Äô during many of its missions. McKenzie survived the war and brought ‚ÄòMyrtle‚Äô back to Australia, later donating it to the Australian War Memorial.

For the next three years her father was far from home, serving with the Royal Australian Air Force.

Murray Haines left Australia on Christmas Day 1942 with No. 30 Squadron, bound for Port Moresby in the Territory of Papua. He did not return until March 1944, and then on 11 May 1945, shortly before Shirley‚Äôs sixth birthday, he again deployed overseas, this time with No. 1 Squadron to Malaya and Indonesia, where he remained until October 1945.

During his time away from home, Haines wrote letters which presented his wartime experiences in a way intended to fill his daughter‚Äôs imagination with excitement and wonder.

In 2014, Rosie became the first artist from Zenadh Kes [Torres Strait Islands] to be commissioned by the Memorial.

‚ÄúInspired by her family‚Äôs wartime history Rosie carved into lino more than 60 images and hand-printed them using gold paint onto long lengths of the black cloth. The result is a lush tapestry which invites us to learn about Torres Strait Islander culture, country and history before, during and after the Second World War.

It is a stunning tribute to the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion but also highlights the little-known home front experiences of remote islander communities in the arguably frontline state of northern Queensland. Including the harsh realities of life for women, children and the elderly on remote islands without the support of their able-bodied men who were serving in the Army and the lasting physical impact of the conflict on the landscape.‚Äù

Their mission was to recruit and train a guerrilla force of the island‚Äôs indigenous Dayak peoples, who would gather intelligence and fight a secret war against the Japanese. Tredrea spent 5 months living off the land and engaging Japanese patrols, only returning after the end of war was announced.

The Hythe camera gun was designed for training aerial gunners during the First World War. Introduced in mid-1916 and designed to emulate the form of a Lewis gun, it was loaded with 120 millimetre film.

Pilots and aerial gunners would stage mock ‚Äòdog fights‚Äô in which the Hythe could be used in lieu of real weaponry. When pulling the trigger as if firing a weapon, the camera gun would capture a series of images. The crosshairs of the sights were then reproduced on the film to show fall of shot.

In doing so, aerial gunners could refer back to the developed photographs to improve their skills in gunnery.

This technology would later evolve into built in gun cameras that came to be used aboard many aircraft. These were used for training, hit confirmation and intelligence purposes.

Cliff had arrived in Australia in August 1942, working as a camp cook in his garrison. Cliff and Maud began dating under the supervision of family members. Their courtship included fresh donuts on Sunday, which had been cooked by Cliff in the garrison kitchens. Cliff proposed to Maud in 1945 but was reposted to New Guinea before their planned wedding.

When the Second World War concluded, Maud applied to travel to the United States of America to join Cliff. There were around 15,000 women who left Australia to live overseas with their spouses, with more than two thirds moving to America. Maud departed Sydney on 14 April 1947, aboard the ‚ÄòBride Boat‚Äô SS Marine Phoenix.

After 3 years, Maude and Cliff were finally reunited and married on 28 June 1947 in New Hampshire.

Since 1899, women have served in the Australian armed forces, but were initially restricted to the Australian Army Nursing Service. It wasn‚Äôt until the Second World War that significant change began.

In 1940, the Women‚Äôs Australian National Service (WANS) was established, proving that women were capable of filling roles traditionally reserved for men. This led to the creation of female branches in the Royal Australian Air Force, Australian Army, and Royal Australian Navy.

Both German and Allied soldiers had to deal with the soft white rocks while digging a trench or sheltering from an exploding artillery shell. Accounts of freshly dug trenches describe the walls being blindingly white thanks to the exposed chalk. Some soldiers decided to carve with it.

This piece was carved to represent a German soldier in their distinctive German army cap including the round cockade. Barely ten centimetres tall, the face has glasses and a moustache, curled up at the ends. The scratched white surface has red and black ink applied to highlight the carved lines. 

Sadly, the identity of the soldier who made it is lost. An inscription on the bottom has mostly worn away. All that we know is that he was a member of the 13th Battalion, who fought on the Somme, sometime between mid-1916 and the end of the War.

A 24-year-old inspector under the Vermin Destruction Act, Johns enlisted in the AIF at Wangaratta, Victoria, on 13 January 1916.

He was posted to the newly raised 37th Battalion, which was formed in Seymour from recruits drawn from Melbourne, north-east Victoria and the Gippsland region.

After initially reaching Sangieng Island, a skeleton crew of ten survivors attempted to sail a lifeboat called Anzac to Australia. After a week at sea, low on both water and food, the crew went ashore at Tjilatjap on the Javanese south coast. 

Japanese troops had already landed on Java, and the men from Anzac were taken prisoner. The Anzac crew agreed that both the lifeboat and Perth needed to be commemorated so Petty Officer Ray Parkin designed and drew the central decoration onto the sail in indelible pencil, before all ten of the Anzac crew signed it. 

To keep the sail from being discovered during captivity it was passed from prisoner to prisoner with the names of all known Perth survivors added later on as a memorial. A poem about the loss of the Perth was also added.

At the outbreak of the First World War, the Gibbs brothers were among many young men who left their studies and life in Australia to serve overseas. 

Younger brother John Harbinger Gibbs was the first to join up, embarking from Melbourne on 17 April 1915. Whilst serving with the 5th Battalion in Gallipoli Private Gibbs fell ill and was moved to the Administration Headquarters in London. 

Older brother Richard Horace Maconochie (Mac) Gibbs, studied medicine before enlisting with the 6th Battalion, embarking on the 28 January 1916. He was later transferred to the 59th Battalion and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant (Lt). 

Within months, Lt. Richard Gibbs was in the thick of intense fighting at Fleubaix, France. He was posthumously awarded the Military Cross for actions made shortly before his death on 19 July 1916, leading his men in a charge under heavy fire. 'Lieut. Gibb's calm and collected manner gave his men the impulse necessary to carry them as far as it was possible to go.'

In the months after his brother's death, Private John Gibbs was repatriated to Australia for his illness and put under the care of his Father, surgeon Richard Horace Gibbs. He died of his illness on 13 October 1917. 

Bereaved by the loss of his two sons, Richard Gibbs decided to leave his practice, devoting his life to the medical care of sick and wounded soldiers returned to Australia. Major Gibbs was appointed as Senior Surgeon at No 16 Australian General Hospital. 

Major Gibbs worked tirelessly for almost 2 years before he was tragically killed in a tram accident. At his funeral a large crowd, including returned soldiers, lined St Kilda Road in Melbourne to honour a man who had helped so many, even after losing so much.

Local photographers catered to the large demand for photos at these iconic locations, and this image of the entire unit has captivated people for years. The Memorial holds three prints of the image, each showing signs of age, leading to the creation of this digitally restored version.

Interestingly, no other unit managed to recreate this scene - most other photographs show smaller groups with the pyramids or Sphinx only as a backdrop.

This glass plate photograph is a true testament to the skill of the unknown photographer, captured with remarkable clarity despite the challenges that would have presented with getting the unit to climb the landmark and stay still.

During his service he took photos which offer an intimate glimpse into life on the Manunda. You can find them on the Memorial's website: https://brnw.ch/21wQN75

Studio photographer Algernon Darge was active in Melbourne from the early 1900s to the 1930s. He set up studios at the military camp locations of Broadmeadows, Seymour, and Point Cook along with his primary studio in Collins Street, Melbourne.

His studio photographed thousands of soldiers in these location prior to overseas service in the First World War. The Memorial bought his wartime negatives in 1939, but it was not until the early 2000s that a cataloguing program started to document the 19,000 glass plate negatives held by the Memorial.

The studio day books were also acquired; these list the client for the image (often the person pictured, but not always). The end product for a photographer is the photograph, but the negative can tell you so much about how they ran their business.

This negative includes three portraits copied from three separate prints. Darge had been appointed as the official photographer for the town of Cobram, who advertised weekly for soldiers associated with the area to submit portraits for inclusion on a future photographic honour board.

These portraits were sent to Darge who copied them and supplied prints back to the town. It is unknown if the town created the board, as no evidence exists, but the advertising for it (in Trove) and the negatives created by Darge do exist.

This image shows Darge not wanting to waste any space on the glass negative by collaging three prints on one plate, a lovely example of studio practice. The white area around one portrait shows the way a photographer could isolate one person from a group to produce a single portrait.

Greer was wearing this grey tropical ward dress when, on 14 February 1942, the Vyner Brooke was sunk by Japanese aircraft. She managed to swim to a piece of wreckage, which was big enough to accommodate several survivors. The survivors on the makeshift raft were caught in a current that moved them near the shores of Sumatra. They were then taken prisoner of war. 

The dress is a grey tropical pattern ward dress, which was custom made for Greer in Singapore. During her captivity, Greer kept her dress clean and neat, saving it for special occasions, such as birthdays, ANZAC Day, Christmas, funerals, and her liberation. 

Greer was liberated in August 1945, and after a period of hospital treatment in Singapore, returned to Australia in October. She was medically discharged on 23 September 1946. 

Greer‚Äôs brother, Lieutenant Bruce Greer, was also a prisoner of war of the Japanese. The Greers are believed to be the only Australian brother/sister prisoner of war siblings.

By October 1915, the Gallipoli campaign had been waged for 6 long and painful months. In the harsh conditions, disease spread rapidly. 

On the island of Lemnos, nurses like Clarice Jessie Daley worked tirelessly in 'desperately hard' conditions to help sick and wounded men who had been evacuated from Gallipoli. 

In July, Nurse Daley's demanding routine was briefly interrupted when she was reunited with an old flame. Ernest and Clarice had known each other in Melbourne before he enlisted in 1914, however their match was not well regarded by Clarice's family at the time. 

Although Sergeant Ernest Lawrence had originally been sent to Lemnos for dental issues, he wasted no time in proposing to his sweetheart. The couple were married on 21 October 1915 at the Church Camp in West Lemnos.  

The rare event was cause for great celebration, however for Clarice it also marked the end of her career. Despite the need for medical personnel in the First World War, married women were not allowed to serve as nurses. 

In February 1916, once Gallipoli had been fully evacuated, Clarice returned to Australia. Ernest returned in November 1918 and the couple went on to have four children together.

For many years curators at the Memorial were unable to confirm the origins of this portrait of the Victoria Cross recipient, with speculation that it may have been taken post-mortem.

The theory arose due to the enlarged hands, the appearance of a wire around the neck holding him up and the detached expression on his face and eyes.

The picture was a copy of the original, which meant that there was no inscription that could provide additional context.

The theory was debunked however when our keen-eyed staff noticed a single pip of a second lieutenant on his shoulder, which dates the photograph between 7 April 1917 and 26 September 1917. Gaby was killed in action on 11 August 1918. 

In 2009 this mystery was solved for good when the Memorial was loaned a copy of the image which had Gaby's own inscription on the verso, confirming that it was taken in Amiens, France while Gaby was still alive. The image can be found here: https://brnw.ch/21wQBAC

Inspired by the Ode of Remembrance, these site-specific pieces, titled ""Quiet Skies, as the sun rises"" and ""Quiet Skies, as the sun sets"", are made from hot-sculpted glass and capture the colours of sunrise and sunset, with each artwork featuring approximately 600 individual glass eucalypt leaves.

Pressed eucalypt leaves made their way into letters from home to the front lines. The leaves‚Äô scent is intensely evocative and for many Australians, eucalypts are a symbol of our country, evoking emotions of connection and longing.

In the East, the sunrise represents resilience and the enduring spirit of those commemorated by war memorials. The rising of the sun, after even the darkest night, suggests the hope that can outlive the horrors of war.

Continuing a tradition extending back to the First World War, Churcher was commissioned by the Australian War Memorial to record images of Australian service personnel as part of Australia's involvement in the International Coalition against Terrorism. 

Stationed in the Persian Gulf, Churcher painted and sketched sailors aboard HMAS Kanimbla and Adelaide as they undertook their duties, daily operations and candid moments. 

After leaving the Middle East, Churcher, travelled to the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. The island hosts a UK/US military base where the RAAF was based supporting operations in the Middle East.

Churcher depicted the environment, life on base, logistics and personnel, as well as American and Australian aircraft on the ‚Äòflight line‚Äô being readied, or returning from operations in the Middle East. His mixture of subjects highlights the human experience in a modern war, readiness, action and rest.

The Holocaust reveals the extremes of humanity‚Äôs capacity for evil, as well as its spirit of endurance and survival. The Holocaust is represented at the Memorial through the experiences of survivors who made new lives in post-war Australia, as well as Australians who witnessed the horrific aftermath of concentration camps.

Official war artist Alan Moore accompanied British troops as they liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in Germany. Moore attempted to represent the truth of what he witnessed in his drawings and paintings. He said:

""The day that I entered Belsen I didn‚Äôt expect anything like it. I forgot about doing anything that the army told me that I had to do ‚Ä¶ I wanted to try and put everything down as well as I could ‚Ä¶ drawing madly all the time. I wanted to show what it was, what was going on.""

This Australian flag was presented to Major John Carr Ewen by the residents of Bellingen - the town where he farmed after emigrating to Australia - when he enlisted in the First World War. He carried the flag as a reminder of Australia throughout the war.

As Australian flags were not issued to units serving overseas, Ewen's flag was often called into service for various ceremonies in France. His mother subsequently embroidered the names and dates on the flag.

But nothing lessens their determination to stay together.""

Identical twins, Warrant Officers John and Alfred Payne, enlisted together in November 1941. They were inseparable throughout their service, only parting once when posted to different squadrons. 

In June 1944, two months into the postings, John was shot down by a Japanese fighter behind enemy lines in Burma. After bailing out at low altitude he was befriended by Naga people, who guided him on the 3-day journey to return to Allied lines.

On the day of his return his brother awaited him, reunited once again in No. 615 'Churchill's Own' (Spitfire) Squadron. The brothers remained together and returned to Australia at the end of the war.

In a 1945 edition of the Air Ministry News Bulletin, the pair were affectionally attributed with 'enlivening' every day at the bases they served with ""a case of mistaken identity"".

Captain George Hammond certainly received one on 25 December 1917. There was no cessation of hostilities for the festive season and Hammond‚Äôs unit, the 28th Battalion, was occupying front line trenches at Ploegsteert, Belgium.

The damage to this cigarette case shows just how lucky Hammond was to survive a bullet from a German sniper. The round tore through his breast pocket striking both his cigarette case and field notebook, narrowly missing him.

Hammond had a reputation as a tenacious soldier. A fellow officer noted: 'I am quite sure that [he] did not know what fear meant‚Ä¶I never once saw him duck for either a shell or a bullet'. Decorated three times and wounded twice, Hammond‚Äôs second injury, in November 1916, left his elbow shattered, rendering his left arm permanently disabled and had to be held in a sling. Hammond did not let this stop him however, insisting on remaining in service.

Sadly Hammond‚Äôs luck eventually ran out. He was mortally wounded by a German sniper at Morlancourt on 11 June, 1918. He was 25 years of age.

We have welcomed back the iconic sculpture of Simpson and his Donkey by Peter Corlett, just in time to greet visitors during the holiday period.

Cast in bronze and standing 2.35m tall, ‚ÄòSimpson and his donkey, 1915‚Äô has been a crowd favourite since it was unveiled at the Memorial in 1988.

The sculpture depicts the bravery of 22-year-old, English-born and Australian enlisted, John Simpson Kirkpatrick and his service during the Gallipoli campaign. Unarmed, Private Simpson used a number of small donkeys to carry men down from the front line, leaving himself exposed to snipers and artillery fire.

Peter Corlett wanted the sculpture to communicate compassion, courage and humility. He portrays a calm and resolved Simpson helping a wounded soldier. 

Simpson and his Donkey can currently be viewed by visitors and will be accessible by Christmas. Read more here: https://brnw.ch/21wPtQx

They were produced to display different styles available. One is plain, the other textured. 

Ultimately neither of these two exact styles were selected for the Roll of Honour when the panels began to be installed in 1961. 

What is interesting about these two sample panels is that the names are listed under a town, rather than unit as is on the Roll of Honour today. Charles Bean‚Äôs initial concept for the Roll of Honour was to list the names of the fallen under the town they were best associated with, as that would be more familiar to family and friends than their unit. 

Identifying a town of association proved too difficult for everyone on the roll, so in 1954 it was decided that names were to be listed under the individual‚Äôs last unit, in alphabetical order, and without rank or decoration.

The two vessels separated and one escaped into Indonesian waters; the other opened fire... ‚öì

During the Indonesian Confrontation, as part of the Commonwealth‚Äôs commitment to safeguard Malaysia‚Äôs independence, the Royal Australian Navy was involved in surveillance in the waters surrounding Malacca and Singapore.

The Ton-class minesweeper HMAS Teal was tasked with patrol duties in the Singaporean Straits, from 1964 to early 1966. Its crew of three officers and thirty ratings operated under the command of Lieutenant Commander Keith ‚ÄòGus‚Äô Murray.

On 6 December 1964, HMAS Teal intercepted a vessel attempting evasion, which was found to be carrying suspected Indonesian infiltrators. One week later, on 13 December, the crew engaged two unlit vessels. When one craft was approached and spotlighted, it opened fire.

Responding swiftly, HMAS Teal returned fire until the vessel surrendered; from the encounter, several men were killed and others wounded. The captured craft was searched, explosives and ammunition seized, and its crew arrested and handed over to Singaporean Police.

Wireless communications allowed minute-accurate, emergency correspondence to be transmitted between HMAS Teal and other RAN, British and Malaysian vessels. This collection of signals to and from HMAS Teal detail the series of engagements as they escalated and were responded to under Murray‚Äôs command across 1964 and 1965. Several signals sent back to HMAS Teal by RAN, British and Malayan naval counterparts congratulate Murray and his crew on their actions.

For his judgement and diligence in upholding naval security as HMAS Teal‚Äôs commanding officer, Murray was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross ‚Äì the only RAN officer to receive this honour during the Indonesian Confrontation.

Originally from Greenacre in Sydney, Sergeant Clement was serving as the Australian Army's Ordnance Corps liaison NCO at the base when he met Staff Sergeant Matthews, who was from Chicago, Illinois.

Their love blossomed, culminating in the pair marrying in a unique ceremony at Saigon, in March 1970. It was the first time in the Vietnam war that an Australian soldier married an American servicewoman.

Just after dawn on 7 December 1941, Japanese planes launched from aircraft carriers struck the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Their primary target was the US Navy‚Äôs Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.

In less than two hours they wrought havoc. As the Japanese pilots winged their way back to their carriers, behind them the harbour was ablaze and thick palls of smoke rose from numerous stricken ships.

Chaos reigned as survivors worked frantically to save those trapped inside ships, or to help the wounded. Shock and disbelief soon gave way to anger and resolve to strike back.

With this audacious attack, both nations now entered the Second World War, making it a truly global conflict.

When the Colony of Victoria commissioned HMCS Victoria in 1854, it was the first warship ordered by an Australian colony. Fitted with both sails and a steam engine, it launched in England a year before arriving in Victoria on 31 May 1856 to serve the colony in scientific, police and military roles. 

When the First Taranaki War broke out in New Zealand in 1860, the Victoria sailed to New Zealand in support of its government. This was the first Australian unit committed to overseas service.

She carried 134 men from the 40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot. Once these troops were disembarked, the crew and vessel remained in New Zealand waters to support the colonial forces. 

This included action against the heavily fortified Maori pa (fort) at Matakoriko on 28 December 1860. Following the end of hostilities, the Victoria returned to Melbourne on 11 April 1861, concluding what is now seen as Australia‚Äôs earliest naval deployment.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, EATS was established to train 50,000 new aircrew annually in order to maintain the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the impending war in Europe. Between November 1940 and March 1945 over 37,000 Australian airmen were trained as part of the scheme. 

Flight Sergeant Edward George Wicky of Manly (left) and his observer Flight Sergeant Oswald Mountford of Leeton were trained through the scheme. Together they completed the 1000th sortie flown since D-Day by No. 464 (Mosquito) Squadron RAAF, which was based at RAF Station Methwold. 

On February 3, 1945, their aircraft took part in a raid by 17 Mosquitoes on enemy targets behind the battle area in Europe.

He wore the other half around his neck. Towers told Henrickson that when the two halves were joined together again, the war would be over, and he would be home forever.

Towers served in Malaya with the 2/29th Battalion and was captured by the Japanese when Singapore fell in February 1942. Henrickson heard nothing of him until the war was over, when she was working in a hospital caring for recently freed prisoners of war. There, she learned from a patient that Towers had died of illness in November 1943. She gave this man the address of Towers‚Äô mother, who passed it on to an officer who had brought his belongings home with him.

When Henrickson visited Mrs Towers, she was amazed to find the matching part of her florin among his personal effects. Mrs Towers gave it to her, and Henrickson donated both pieces to the Memorial in 1998 with a photograph of Towers wearing the outer part of the florin with his identity discs.

Presented to Lt Col Eric Smith (Commanding Officer of 7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment) by Lt Col John Warr (Commanding Officer of 5th Battalion), the Tiger Pig was purported to be the mascot of 5RAR, otherwise known as ‚ÄòTiger Five‚Äô.

The pig, which was painted by Corporals Robert Kearney and John Thomas Mulby to imitate a tiger, was handed over to Lt Col Smith in a ceremony prior to the 5th Battalion returning home to Australia.

The emblem of the newly arrived 7th Battalion was a laughing pig, which 5RAR seemingly deemed made them suitable to be recipient of the Tiger Pig.

He shared the ambition for the original dioramas, not only to create educational models, but to convey something of the reality of war through art. 

Visitors to our travelling exhibition Art in Conflict are drawn to his sculptures, especially this depiction of the trenches of the Western Front, ‚ÄòThe mud, the flies, the cold, the rats, the lack of sleep‚Äô. At only 45 cm wide, it is packed with tiny details showing survival in miserable conditions.

Art in Conflict includes more than 70 contemporary artists and is on display at Glasshouse Port Macquarie until 2 February 2025.

This tragic event is the most significant loss in the history of the Royal Australian Navy, and was a devastating moment for the Rosevear family who lost brothers Geoffrey and Lance in the event. 

Born in Launceston, Tasmania, the Rosevear brothers both entered the Royal Australian Navy when they finished school. Older brother Geoffrey trained as a rangefinder before joining light cruiser HMAS Sydney II in 1936. Lance joined the crew in 1938, where the brothers served side by side for more than two years.

During the Second World War, Geoffrey was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for his commendable actions during the Sydney's encounter with the Italian light cruiser Bartolomeo Colleoni on July 19, 1940. 

In February 1941, HMAS Sydney II returned to its home port of Sydney, where the crew was welcomed by jubilant crowds. Many of the sailors were granted a well-deserved leave, and Lance seized the opportunity to return to Launceston to marry his sweetheart, Olive Killworth.

On 19 November 1941 HMAS Sydney II was attacked the Kormoran, resulting in mortal damage to both ships. HMAS Sydney II was last seen ablaze by the Germans as she disappeared over the horizon, before sinking with the loss of all hands.

The Link Trainer flight simulator, colloquially known as a ‚ÄòBlue Box‚Äô is an enclosed flight simulator that was used to train pilots in instrument and blind flying during the Second World War.

The trainer utilised a series of pumps, valves and bellows to achieve an accurate simulation of controls and instrumentation. It was able to simulate, pitch, yaw and roll, as well as vibration and forestall. The trainer featured a removable canopy, allowing for open top or closed ‚Äòblind‚Äô flight. 

When enclosed, trainees received instructions through a headset connected to a microphone used by the instructor. The simulated ‚Äòflight‚Äô of the pilot was charted through graph paper readouts, generated by an electronically operated ‚Äòtracker.‚Äô 

Over 10,000 Link Trainers were manufactured in the United States. During the war the RAAF utilised around 170 of these devices. This trainer, A13-13 entered service in June of 1942, remaining in use until the war‚Äôs end. Pilots trained on this ‚ÄòBlue Box‚Äô would fly missions in both the South West Pacific and European theatres.

The allied armies had driven the German invaders back, having inflicted heavy defeats upon them over the preceding four months.

In November, the Germans called for an armistice (suspension of fighting) in order to secure a peace settlement. They accepted allied terms that amounted to unconditional surrender.

The 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month attained a special significance in the post-war years. It marked the moment when hostilities ceased on the Western Front, and became universally associated with the remembrance of those who had died in the war.

In 1964 he covered the Indonesian Confrontation and soon after undertook some of his best known work covering the Vietnam War.

Davis was known for his atypical approach, often reporting from the South Vietnamese perspective. Desiring to report the effects of war and those fighting it, he operated on the front line and was wounded several times.

After reporting on the Cambodian civil war, Davis covered the end of the Vietnam War. In 1975 he captured iconic footage of a North Vietnamese tank breaking down the gates of the Independence Palace in Saigon, he was the only Western cameraman to do so.

On 9 September, 1985, Davis was covering a coup attempt in Bangkok, Thailand with his sound recordist, Bill Latch, when they were killed by a spray of shrapnel. His camera captured his final moments. As the camera rolled, fellow correspondent Gary Burns dragged his fallen colleague from the street.

This posthumous Logie Hall of Fame Award was presented to Burns on behalf of Davis‚Äô family in 1985, and later donated the Award to the Australian War Memorial.

In today's Last Post Ceremony we remember Adjutant William (Bill) Bramwell Tibbs, who was killed on 19 December 1943.

Bill Tibbs was born in Armidale on 29 October 1909 and began serving with the Salvation Army when he was 19. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Bill embarked with the 9th Division on the HMAT Aquitania bound for the Middle East.

Bill was with Australian troops during the siege of Tobruk, where he became known as ‚ÄúBighearted Bill"". Although not a combatant, he worked tirelessly and experienced the same hardships as other soldiers. 

For the next two years, Bill Tibbs continued to provide invaluable support to Australian troops, serving in Aleppo and El Alamein. He is perhaps, best known for his 'Sermon in the Sandhills' made shortly after the Battle of El Alamein. 

In September 1943 he was awarded British Empire Medal for devotion to duty for risking his life during the battle of El Alamein to bring coffee to advanced troops under fire.

Upon his return to Australia, Bill was promoted to Deputy Commissioner of the Salvation Army.

The Memorial‚Äôs Research Centre digitises over half-a-million pages from its archive annually, making them available online via the Memorial‚Äôs Collection Search: https://brnw.ch/21wOqJX

Amongst the Memorial‚Äôs rich collection of digitised material is the First World War autograph book belonging to Matron Margaret Gray, an Australian nurse who served with the Red Cross.

Matron Gray worked at the Brighton Hospital in England before being sent to the Red Cross Hospital, Rouen, where she treated both British and Australian patients. The pages of her autograph book are filled with occasional sketches, humorous poems and, most frequently, incredibly heartfelt messages from those under her care.

Many patients expressed a particular fondness for her night-time deliveries of cocoa, referring to her as the ‚Äòcocoa lady‚Äô and mentioning her ‚Äòjolly cocoa parties‚Äô.

The Pageant of the Southern Cross was an allegorical pageant play, performed at Victoria Palace in London on 19 October 1917 to raise funds for the Anzac Buffet.

With few surviving records of the pageant, the only known colour images are costume designs by Australian artist, Hilda Rix Nicholas (1884‚Äì1961).

The Memorial has acquired 39 designs in coloured crayon from the artist‚Äôs family, with the generous support of the Australian government through the National Heritage Account.

These vibrant, evocative drawings allow contemporary audiences to gain impressions of the pageant, highlighting its conception and richness of colour, as well as revealing a little known aspect of women‚Äôs wartime work.

Given the moniker of the 'Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels', an estimated 37,000 Papuans and New Guineans served during the campaign.

The term came from a poem in 1942, when Sapper Bert Beros of the 7th Division, Royal Australian Engineers, wrote expressing fondness towards the ‚Äúblack angels‚Äù who assisted the Australians in the war against Japan.

On the night of 16 August 1944, FL Hammet and the crew of Liberator KG933, 178 Squadron were flying a covert mission in support of the Polish Home Army‚Äôs uprising in Warsaw. The operation required supply drops to be executed at low speed and attitude, making them amongst the most dangerous aerial missions of the war. 

FL Hammet managed to parachute from the plane, narrowly escaping its crash into Oskar Schindler‚Äôs factory. Wounded from shrapnel, he spent a number of nights sheltering in the forest before approaching a farmhouse for help. The woman who lived there sent word to the Polish Home Army, who sheltered him in a series of safe houses while he recovered from his injuries.

It was during this time that Hammet fell in love with resistance fighter Jadwiga Wielowieyska, and decided to become a Home Army Partisan to support the resistance efforts. For six months Hammet participated in raids that weakened German control. 

After Germany surrendered Poland to the Soviet Army in 1945, FL Allan Hammet returned home to Australia via England, accompanied by his now wife Jadwiga and her young daughter Rosmarie.

In late 1943, Ern Dunkley transferred to No. 464 (RAAF) Squadron to fly Mosquito fighter-bombers.

On 31 October 1944, Ern led a section of four aircraft low over Denmark to attack the Gestapo Headquarters at Aarhus University. The operation successfully destroyed vital information held by the Gestapo and allowed Danish resistance leaders to escape into Sweden.

This was just one of 76 operations that Ern Dunkley successfully flew over enemy territory. In another, Ern managed to take out a V-1 rocket in the air during a dangerous, low-level attack on a German launch site. 

Ern also assisted during the critical days after Allies landed in Normandy on D-Day, where he carried out risky night attacks on enemy transport. In 2005, he was honoured with the Legion d‚ÄôHonneur award for his contribution to the liberation of France.

Squadron Leader Ern Dunkley returned to Australia after the war and reunited with his wife and twin children, Jan and Phillip, who were born just days before he embarked for overseas service.
